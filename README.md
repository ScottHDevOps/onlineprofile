# Scott's Online Profile Website

Hey! The idea of this project is to create an asynchonus bond between a javascript client and a node.js backend, and allow clients to alter static website properties that are shared across all clients, allowing one client to change everyones expirience.

This system has been developed primarily as a proof of concept to show how node.js and javascript can allow you to not only interact with a server from a client browser but also how other clients can enhance and change your expirience as well.
